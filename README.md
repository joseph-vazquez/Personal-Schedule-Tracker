# Personal-Schedule-Tracker
This is a program that records the users upcoming week's schedules with dates and times. Implemented into the tracker that once all the information was received from the user it would print the schedule on a easy to read text file. This is a text base program that runs off of java.

I've been working on this from 1/2024 - 6/2024.
I hope this helps you as it helps me.

** NOTES:

There is going to be a Verison 2 of this program that actually uses Java FX and runs the same program in a GUI window. That will be coming soon.
