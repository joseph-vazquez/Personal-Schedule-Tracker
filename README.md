# Personal-Schedule-Tracker

** WHAT IS THIS **
This is a program that records the users upcoming week's schedules with dates and times. Implemented into the tracker that once all the information was received from the user it would print the schedule on a easy to read text file. This is a text base program that runs off of java. Please take a look at the jpg in the files called "ScheduleExample.JPG" to see how the schedule looks like on the printed out text file for the user.


** HOW TO START PROGRAM **
To start the program make sure you have all the files downloaded in the same area and make sure you use "ScheduleStarter.java" and to use that main method to start the program


** FROM ME **
I've been working on this from 1/2024 - 6/2024.
I hope this helps you as it helps me.
And yes i actually do use this

** NOTES **

There is going to be a Verison 2 of this program that actually uses Java FX and runs the same program in a GUI window. That will be coming soon.
